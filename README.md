### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Valeria Oparina, I'm a Data Analyst

I like to explore patterns and connections in different fields, be it work or hobby. I like to dive deep into the topic, understand the essence of the processes, and also look for the best ways to solve problems.

I chose to study data analysis because it is a logical step in my career in IT. Here I can combine my technical skills, analytical thinking and creative abilities. It is important for me that my work has a direct impact on business development.

###### Data Analysis:
Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Statsmodels, Scipy

###### Databases: 
SQL, PostgreSQL

###### Other Tools:
Excel, Jupyter Notebook, Tableau, Power BI
